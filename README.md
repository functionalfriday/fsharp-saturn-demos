# fsharp-saturn-demos

## Progress

- [x] Login via OAuth2 Github (thx Martin!)
- [x] persistence: talk to a database (sqlite)

## Challenges

- most frameworks & docs are tailored for Windows and .NET Framework -> difficult with linux &
  dotnet5
- official Saturn docs are not easy to understand if you don't know Giraffe
- official dotnet templates are crap for dotnet5 (and dotnet core 3)
- we don't want to use fake/paket: we are using nuget with rider & linux

## Demo app

For learning we will use `WineTasting` as "Domain".

See [README](WineTasting/WineTastingApp/README.md) for details. That file is a mix between ADRs and
CHANGELOGS and ... ;-)
